#+TITLE: X Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Nahuel Jes√∫s Sacchetti

* Introduction

Welcome to my X configuration file. Here I've a literate programming
version of my X.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The xinit program allows a user to manually start an X display server.
The startx script is a front-end for xinit.
#+END_QUOTE

Please note that to build this file you will need
Emacs with =org-mode= and =org-plus-contrib= package.

** =TODOs=

This section is intended to have all the things I want =todo= but I do
not have time to right now.

* Shebang

As in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)][Wikipedia]]...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the
characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a
script. It is also called sha-bang, hashbang, pound-bang, or hash-pling.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#! /bin/bash
#+END_SRC

* Set Configuration Directory

Since all my configurations are in my directory (which is this
respository) I always set my environment variable to have an standard
access everywhere.

*Note:* The installation script always moves this repository folder to
=$HOME= and then renames it to =.nwtb=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export NWTB_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.nwtb"
#+END_SRC

* Better Visuals

I use a composite manager to have better defaults in my Window Manager.
I've a configuration of my own in this respository and I call it on
execution. Check the configuration file
[[[[file+emacs:~/.nwtb/configurations/X/compton.conf][here]]]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
compton --config $NWTB_CONFIG_DIR/configurations/X/compton.conf &
#+END_SRC

* Windows Manager

And finally, execute my Windows Manager.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
exec i3
#+END_SRC
