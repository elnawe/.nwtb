#+TITLE: Termite Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Nahuel Jes√∫s Sacchetti

* Introduction

Welcome to my Termite configuration file. Here I've a literate programming
version of my Termite.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Termite is an easy to use and easy to configure RS232 terminal. It uses
an interface similar to that of "messenger" or "chat" programs, with a
large window that contains all received data and an edit line for typing
in strings to transmit. Highlights of the utility are the ease of
installation (possibly with pre-configured settings) using a heuristic
search for the appropriate COM port and, as was mentioned, its
user-friendliness.
#+END_QUOTE

Please note that to build this file you will need
Emacs with =org-mode= and =org-plus-contrib= package.

* Hints

Termite lets you use the keyboard for URLs and that's great. I just
change how they look to match =cVim= as I use that in =Chromium=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[hints]
active_background = #f8ed62
active_foreground = #3f3f3f
background = #f8ed62
border = #a98600
border_width = 1
foreground = #000000
font = Monospace 10
padding = 2
roundness = 1.0
#+END_SRC

* Options

#+BEGIN_SRC  bash
[options]
allow_bold = true
audible_bell = false
clickable_url = true
cursor_blink = on
cursor_shape = block
dynamic_title = true
filter_unmatched_urls = true
font = Monospace 9
mouse_autohide = true
scroll_on_keystroke = true
scroll_on_output = false
scrollback_lines = 10000
search_wrap = true
urgent_on_bell = true
#+END_SRC

* Theming

Match Zenburn, even with my Terminal.

*Note:* I just set a base16 color but you are able to set 255 colors.
Also =Termite= supports true color but I don't really care about that.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
[colors]
background = #3f3f3f
foreground = #dcdccc
foreground_bold = #ffffff

highlight = #2f2f2f

color0 = #2b2b2b
color1 = #bc8383

color3 = #e0cf9f
color4 = #7cb8bb
color5 = #dc8cc3
color6 = #93e0e3
color7 = #dcdccc
