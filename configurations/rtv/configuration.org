#+TITLE: RTV Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Nahuel Jes√∫s Sacchetti

* Introduction

Welcome to my Rtv configuration file. Here I've a literate programming
version of my Rtv.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
RTV provides an interface to view and interact with reddit from your terminal.
It's compatible with most terminal emulators on Linux and OS X.
#+END_QUOTE

Please note that to build this file you will need
Emacs with =org-mode= and =org-plus-contrib= package.

** =TODOs=

This section is intended to have all the things I want =todo= but I do
not have time to right now.

* General Settings

This part contains a lot of the common settings that you need for Rtv to
work as well as some personal configurations. Also, I love the
