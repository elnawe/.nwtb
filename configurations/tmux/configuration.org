#+TITLE: Tmux Configuration File
#+AUTHOR: Nahuel Jes√∫s Sacchetti

* Introduction

Welcome to my tmux configuration file. Here I've a literate programming
version of my tmux.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between
several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the
background) and reattach them to a different terminal. And do a lot
more.
#+END_QUOTE

Please note that to build this file you will need
Emacs with =org-mode= and =org-plus-contrib= package.

** =TODOs=

This section is intended to have all the things I want =todo= but I do
not have time to right now.

** Notes

As most of this Terminal programs and configurations you will see things
like =C-v=, this means =Control-v= (the letter =v=).

* Theming

Colorizing is not what I do the best but sometimes I like to do it.
Specially because I like to keep it personal.

** Messages

When Tmux want to says something...

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g message-bg green
set -g message-fg black
#+END_SRC

** Mode

When in =copy-mode=, I like to keep the styles.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
setw -g mode-bg green
setw -g mode-fg black
#+END_SRC

** Panes

Panes are splitted windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g pane-border-fg white
set -g pane-border-bg black
set -g pane-active-border-fg green
set -g pane-active-border-bg black
#+END_SRC

** Status Bar

A nice-looking status bar with great information, because I mostly use
Terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g status-bg black
set -g status-fg white
set -g status-left ""
set -g status-position top
set -g status-right "#[bold] #{pane_current_path}\
    #[default,fg=cyan]#S\
    #{online_status}\
    #[default] #[bg=green,fg=black] %A, %B %d %H:%M "
set -g status-right-length 200
#+END_SRC

** Windows

The windows list.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g window-status-current-format "#[bg=green,fg=black] #I #W "
set -g window-status-format " #I #W "

setw -g window-status-fg white
#+END_SRC

* Keyboard Bindings

As Tmux is a keyboard-driven Terminal multiplexer, I've quite a few
keyboard bindings to do the job. Here they are.

** Mode keys

When copying/pasting in Tmux you will have to move to =copy-mode=. Since
that mode is more like navigation inside the window you need a new setup
of keybindings. I use the default keybindings of Emacs for this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
setw -g mode-keys emacs
#+END_SRC

** Reload Configuration

Make Emacs create the new configuration and then make Tmux reload.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bind r run "sh $HOME/.nwtb/build-org-files.sh --tmux && tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf && tmux display-message Reloaded!"
#+END_SRC

** The Tmux Key

I've seen most configurations are using the default =C-b= or a most
accessible =C-a=, but I actually prefer =C-v=. Why? Because =C-b= is the
way I go backwards in Emacs.

Note: =send-prefix= keybinding is because I press two times Tmux key, I
send that command to the Terminal/program.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
unbind-key C-b

set prefix C-v
bind C-v send-prefix
#+END_SRC

** Window Management

In Tmux, a window is like a new tab on a session. I like to keep those
handy!

*** Create windows with name

Use =new-window= to create a new window with a name (prompted at time of
creation).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bind C command-prompt -p "Name:" "new-window -n '%%'"
#+END_SRC

*** Navigation

Use =vi-like= navigation in between panes.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R
#+END_SRC

*** Splitting

Unbind the defaults, bind =|= for horizontal splitting and =-= for
vertical splitting. They pretty much explain themselves.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
unbind '"'
unbind %

bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v
#+END_SRC

* Plugins

Plugins for Tmux are great. Also =tpm= or Tmux Plugin Manager is an
excellent tool to install them really easily.

** Set plugins

List of plugins I use.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-online-status'
#+END_SRC

** Plugin configuration

These are the plugins configurations.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @online_icon '#[fg=brightgreen]online'
set -g @offline_icon '#[fg=brightred]offline'
#+END_SRC

** Run Tmux Plugin Manager

This is a really important line. Starts the =tpm= after all
configuration is done.

*Note:* I sometimes use my phone and =tpm= doesn't run because of
folders are incompatible. That's why I do not initialize tpm if I'm on
phone.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if-shell "uname -o | grep -q GNU/Linux" "run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'"
#+END_SRC
