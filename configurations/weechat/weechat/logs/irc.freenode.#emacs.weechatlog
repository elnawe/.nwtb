2017-07-12 20:27:47	nawe	But I'm using the highlight func for Spaceline and it looks really good to have both sides with the highlight thingy
2017-07-12 20:28:10	nawe	when you change the file it looks red and if it's read-only (view-mode) it's blue
2017-07-12 20:28:35	nawe	I actually use view mode a lot so I can navigate/read the file with hjkl

2017-07-12 20:58:57	diegs_	if not, _may_ be a pain in the ass lol
2017-07-12 20:59:53	deech	As a matter of fact, I am using evil and [ b is currently mapped to previous-buffer. I'd like it to do something else.
2017-07-12 21:00:04	scottj	deech: keychord
2017-07-12 21:00:13	diegs_	wait, you don't need keychord for this with evil
2017-07-12 21:00:17	scottj	deech: nm, keychord is if not using evil
2017-07-12 21:00:53	deech	diegs_: I looked in evil-maps.el and I can't see how previous-buffer is being mapped to that in the first place.
2017-07-12 21:01:10	diegs_	deech: i don't have that
2017-07-12 21:01:14	diegs_	so it must not be evil doing that?
2017-07-12 21:01:51	diegs_	deech: but what about (define-key 'evil-normal-state-map "[b" 'whatever-you-want)
2017-07-12 21:01:53	deech	Here's what `describe-key` says: "[ b runs the command previous-buffer (found in evil-normal-state-map)"
2017-07-12 21:02:04	diegs_	weird
2017-07-12 21:02:12	diegs_	well, no, that could be put there by anything else
2017-07-12 21:02:20	diegs_	i'd inspect your packages/config more closely
2017-07-12 21:02:33	deech	Let me give that a shot.
2017-07-12 21:02:55	diegs_	deech: wait, are you using spacemacs
2017-07-12 21:03:09	diegs_	they do all kindsa fuckery we here are not so well aquantied with
2017-07-12 21:03:56	deech	Yes! And it installed this package called evil-unimpaired that does it. Weird.
2017-07-12 21:04:30	diegs_	in general, try to lead with that you use spacemacs (though to be fair you may get a good amount of shit here if you lead with that)
2017-07-12 21:04:37	diegs_	lol, but it gives a better idea of your context
2017-07-12 21:04:52	diegs_	deech: anyway, does the define-key exrpession i mentioned not work?
2017-07-12 21:05:38	deech	diegs_: Almost, here's what's in evil-unimpaired. (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "[ b") 'previous-buffer)
2017-07-12 21:05:54	diegs_	sure
2017-07-12 21:06:02	diegs_	works too
2017-07-12 21:06:09	diegs_	or, may be the only way it works, i don't quite remember
2017-07-12 21:06:15	deech	lol
2017-07-12 21:06:17	diegs_	the kbd, I mean

2017-07-12 21:06:53	deech	I see other keybindings that just do '(define-key ... "\C-blah")'.
2017-07-12 21:07:12	diegs_	right, it depends on stuff and when (not)? to use kbd is never something i really mastered
2017-07-12 21:07:26	diegs_	regardless
2017-07-12 21:07:27	diegs_	try both

(2) is a result of their recdesc parsing being deeply intermingled with the business logic, so it is impossible to validate or verify any part of the parsing.

2017-07-13 02:24:14	andrekorol	Have you guys heard of FreeBSD using KARL now?
2017-07-13 02:24:23	twb	andrekorol: I thought that was OpenBSD
2017-07-13 02:24:34	andrekorol	Yeah, one of the two...
2017-07-13 02:24:50	andrekorol	I couldn't discuss it properly on any linux related channel...
2017-07-13 02:25:06	andrekorol	Do you think it will be implemented on Linux anytime soon?
2017-07-13 02:25:37	dorothyw	You mean Karl?
2017-07-13 02:25:55	andrekorol	dorothyw: Yes!
2017-07-13 02:26:27	dorothyw	Seems very obscure but could be eventually.
2017-07-13 02:27:06	andrekorol	dorothyw: I thought so...
2017-07-13 02:27:10	twb	andrekorol: nope
2017-07-13 02:27:18	andrekorol	twb: Why not?
2017-07-13 02:27:22	twb	andrekorol: linux moves slowly on stuff like that
2017-07-13 02:27:35	twb	andrekorol: openbsd can be more agile because they don't have a fuckton of manky drivers &c
2017-07-13 02:27:45	dorothyw	Linux has to support alot of hardware vendors and also be backwards compatible whereas openbsd has more freedom to change
2017-07-13 02:28:01	twb	plus linux cares less about security
2017-07-13 02:28:19	andrekorol	twb: That's true... Some Linux developers said we won't see it in this decade...
2017-07-13 02:28:39	twb	of course if openbsd really cared about security they'd use a microkernel
2017-07-13 02:28:56	andrekorol	dorothyw: That's right. OpenBSD has some advantages on that matter
2017-07-13 02:29:36	andrekorol	twb: What's better on microkernels? Sorry, but I'm still on my first year of Computer Science...
2017-07-13 02:30:04	twb	andrekorol: more separation

2017-07-13 02:33:35	dorothyw	I disagree. I think hololens is going to extend the desktop.

2017-07-13 02:37:23	andrekorol	And now you guys just made me believe even more in that

2017-07-13 02:37:54	dorothyw	Hololens is a step ahead of VR because it is windows 10 holographic desktop. you can plays windows in the air in front of your face or beside you or anywhere as if having multiple monitors

2017-07-27 04:09:42	azzamsa	defanor: Yes. I am just search it. how to move file using rsync, I think it just for backup between server. something like git-annex,unison and etc.
2017-07-27 04:10:15	azzamsa	any suggestion for this " I want to have a keyboard centric file manager like ncdu, mc, or ranger. but I want to have easy way to cut and paste. something like tabbed in GUI filemanager. so I can have multiple tabs, cut here, and paste there. In mc, sunrise, dired. i have to type the destination dir when i want to move file"
2017-07-27 04:10:35	defanor	it can be used for that too, but also handy for local sync sometimes -- mostly because of those progress reports, for large files

2017-07-27 05:25:39	twb	Jefe: FYI, systemd already replaced FHS completely.  i.e. you cannot be systemd and FHS compliant at the same time
2017-07-27 05:26:10	Jefe	Sounds about right.
2017-07-27 05:26:19	defanor	so, it seems to not make much sense to use `env sh`, yet `env perl` could still be usable
2017-07-27 05:26:22	Jefe	The great thing about standards....

2017-07-27 05:27:14	twb	That for example contradicts systemd's requirement that usernames must not start with an ASCII digit byte
2017-07-27 05:29:16	 *	Jefe patiently waits for someone to write an init system better than systemd, one which is logical both in operation and function, and which doesn't completely take over a system like stage-4 cancer.

I have a local binding `query' that I'm trying to access from within a (cl-function (lambda ...)), but it seems to be not bound (which I blame dynamic binding on). the function is used in the :success part of a request (so it's not run in the dynamic extent of the original binding)

2017-07-27 10:23:12	fledermaus	forcer: so, I did some digging. The way lui updates the buffer-undo-list is to mapcar over it and assign the altered result back into buffer-undo-list
2017-07-27 10:23:26	fledermaus	this seems to trigger the GC bug, with strings getting double-freed.
2017-07-27 10:23:52	fledermaus	the way erc does it is to use incf and friends on the buffer-undo-list entries.

2017-07-27 15:13:31	yegortimoshenko	since emacs has so many predefined key bindings, you might want to only pass key chords that start with a certain prefix. in exwm there is a distinction between passing only those keys that aren't listed in emacs keymaps (line-mode) and only those that start with a prefix (char-mode). i ended up using char-mode and unsetting C-f for exwm windows since i don't really use it in emacs
2017-07-27 15:14:09	yegortimoshenko	i ended up using s/char-mode/line-mode/

2017-07-27 15:22:08	technomancy	if I have two displays, then I need the ability to change workspaces on each independently, which for some reason people who create non-tiling WMs are not smart enough to figure out how to implement.

The emacs wiki page says "^" matches start of line, but it appears to consider the first non-whitespace character on a line as "start of line". Is there a way to avoid this behavior that I'm missing?
